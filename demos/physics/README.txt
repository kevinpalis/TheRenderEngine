Physics Demo
------------

The physics demo shows how to use the integrated Box2D-Web physics engine to run a simulation.  It demonstrates the following:

* Sprite loading and rendering with the sprite component
* Using MouseInput component to capture mouse events
* Physics simulation
* Rigid body components
* Using the MouseJoint component to move rigid bodies
